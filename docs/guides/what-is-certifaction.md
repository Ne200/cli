## End to end encryption

We process your PDF documents locally instead of sending them to a central server outside of your control.
When we need to store documents, we always encrypt them client side before sending them to us.
If you need to share document references, you can always protect them with a cryptographically strong
password.

## Legally valid identity check

Certifaction supports several signature levels from a standard electronic signature (SES) to the
qualified electronic signatures (QES). In addition, Certifaction introduced the professional
electronic signatures ([PES](https://certifaction.com/professional-electronic-signature-pes/)),
which combine instant ID check with a convenient simple signature.

## Verifiable signatures for printed documents

You can secure your printed documents with a [Digital Twin](https://certifaction.com/digital-twin/).
Digital Twins bridge printed documents and their digital originals.
In this way, you can instantly see their digital original on screen, verify their authenticity,
wand eliminate any document fraud risks. And you can download their securely stored digital copy to your device.
